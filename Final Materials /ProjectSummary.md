# Tornado Alley Is Moving. And Now, Sports
### WHAT WE KNOW
* Tornado Alley, the area of the world with the highest density of tornadoes is drifting east-southeast
* The centroid of all tornado strengths is moving eastward with more powerful tornadoes moving more southward as well 
* The frequency and strength of those tornadoes is also increasing with EF1s growing just as, if not more, frequent than EF0s in spring
* The peak season of tornadoes is moving earlier into the year 
* Despite all of this, the mean casualties (deaths and injuries directly and indirectly related to the torndado) have decreased over time

### WHAT CAN WE PREDICT ABOUT THIS?
Almost nothing. These data are terrifically noisy, and while we can indicate trends, the actionable steps are hard to define and nebulous actions besides. The public is aware of tornadoes, interest in tornadoes is fairly seasonal with occasional spikes when a particularly intense tornado deals significant damage. This is textbook sampling bias - the majority of tornadoes inflict neither deaths nor injuries, so are never reported on the news. 

***While Tornado Alley is shifting, the shift hasn't been sudden.*** What drift exists is only visible in the scale of decades, and in that time, NOAA's storm prediction technology has exponentially improved. What was a terrifying, unknowable monster in 1991 is now a predictable weather event pinpointed to within a city block dozens of minutes before it arrives. The rise in predictive capabilities has "raised all ships," as it were, and nationwide awareness and preparedness of tornadoes is remarkably strong.  

### ROLLING DEEP
One notable difference in tornadoes is the increase in clustering. Prior to around 1990, tornadoes were often single funnels. Since then, tornadoes have increasingly arrived in weaker clusters of several tornadoes. This clustering behavior has accelerated and moved further southeast. This may help explain the increase in total tornadoes and decrease in casualties.
